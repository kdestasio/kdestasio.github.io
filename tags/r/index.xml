      <description>This post walks through an exploratory k-means clustering analysis as applied to numerical data from a dot probe task. Steps to preprocess and analyze the data are discussed and the results are presented through visualizations, as well as a discussion of the results. All code used in the analysis and in the production of this blog post is available at https://github.com/kdestasio/hc_analysis. For additional resources on clustering, see the references section at the bottom of the post.</description>
