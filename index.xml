      <description>I am a scientific researcher and aspiring programmer interested in creating usable interfaces through data driven insights. While I have learned a great deal of programing through self-instruction, I decided in Fall of 2019 to attend Lane Community College for formal training in computer programming and am currently studying to earn an Associate of Applied Science in Computer Programming.
I earned an M.S. in Psychology from the University of Oregon where I was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow in the Social and Affective Neuroscience Lab.</description>

      <description>This post walks through an exploratory k-means clustering analysis as applied to numerical data from a dot probe task. Steps to preprocess and analyze the data are discussed and the results are presented through visualizations, as well as a discussion of the results. All code used in the analysis and in the production of this blog post is available at https://github.com/kdestasio/hc_analysis. For additional resources on clustering, see the references section at the bottom of the post.</description>

      <description>When learning to write code for research projects, it can be overwhelming to figure out how to set-up a project and the novice programmer may not yet have the experience necessary to forsee potential pitfalls of a given, seemingly inconsequential decision. This post provides a discussion of best practices1 for developing code-based projects and for writing R code in a research setting with an eye toward proactively avoiding common pitfalls.</description>
