      <description>General I am a data scientist and programmer who recieved an M.S. in Psychology from the University of Oregon where I was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow in the Social and Affective Neuroscience Lab. My research focused on decision making and goal pursuit as related to health outcomes, using behavioral and neuroimaging methods.
Prior to my graduate studies, I was a full-time project coordinator on an NIH-funded study investigating the feasibility of reversing deficits in inhibitory control associated with early life adversity; a collaboration between Drs.</description>

      <description>When learning to write code for research projects, it can be overwhelming to figure out how to set-up a project and the novice programmer may not yet have the experience necessary to forsee potential pitfalls of a given, seemingly inconsequential decision.
